# Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. 
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

# Motivation

For this project I was interested in analysing the Airbnb Data of the listings in Seattle; particularly I wanted to answer some questions:

1. What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle? By how much do prices spike?
2. What is the most expensive neighbourhood?
3. Do hosts with higher rating have higher revenue?
4. Which facilities of the house contribute more to the price?

I wanted to answer these questions for both academic and curiosity purpose, the informations extracted can give the user an interesting point of view about the city but also about when, where and what list on the platform to maximize the profit.

# File Description

The questions are answered in one Jupyter Notebook where you can see the full analysis, in the repository there are also the CSV files used for the investigation.
However the source files are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle).

# Results
The main findings with the answers of the questions can be found [here]().
